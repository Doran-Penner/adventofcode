; woohoo! now we do part 2
; we can keep the lists sorted, but may not use that fact;
; I know it'd be way faster to do that, but I'm lazy
; and learning this language
; (also hard to use sorted-ness when we have Theta(k) access time
; for the kth element of the list; the best we could do is stop
; once we no longer see the element, but asymptotically that
; changes nothing (ðŸ¤“) so I say it's whateverrrr)
